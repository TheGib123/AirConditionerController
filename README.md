# AirConditionerController
a raspberry pi program and website used to power air conditioner on and off 

This program will only work with a raspberry pi and a ir sender

the Lirc files are the configuration files for my personal air conditioner unit. So you will need to configure your own for yours 

the web files are to be put into a apache web server and can be used as an on off button for the air conditioner unit 

auto.sh is a program I wrote to power on my air conditioner between 4:00pm - 4:05pm every day
